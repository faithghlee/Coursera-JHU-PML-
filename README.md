# Coursera-JHU-PML-
Final assignment from John's Hopkins data science ML course
Just a Quick Note: 

The .html file is messy at the start so please scroll down to read the .html file. 
There is also a .pdf version of this file as well. To clarify cross -validation, i have split training set into 60% for training and 40% for cross-validation.

Thanks!
